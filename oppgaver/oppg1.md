## The first task will be around the domain of the app. 

For the domain we discussed we should make classes, constructors and functions corresponding to the logic these should have to each other.

For the first part just implementing classes and constructors for each in the domain in [domain.py](/backend/domain.py) file.

for the second part we are making the logic they should have with eachother.
